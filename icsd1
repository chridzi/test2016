1.Parasomnias are listed in both the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) (2014) {InternationalClassificationOfSleep 2014}

2.	ICSD
a.	 “Alcohol and parasomnia (ICSD-3 237-238)
Disorders of arousal should not be diagnosed in the presence of alcohol intoxication. The behavior of the alcohol-intoxicated individual may superficially resemble that of the sleepwalker. However, the sleepwalker is typically severely cognitively impaired, but with only limited motor impairment. The alcohol-intoxicated individual’s level of cognitive functioning may be reduced, but not absent, whereas motor behavior is often severely impaired. In alcoholic blackouts, where anterograde amnesia is, by definition,  the cardinal manifestation, it is important to note that outward motor behavior and cognitive function may not be impaired and may be perceived as normal. Thus, the importance of appreciating the neuroscience of alcoholic blackouts and its potential role in the explanation of unusual and bizarre nocturnal behaviors cannot be understated because these can mimic parasomnias. The former are exponentially more prevalent and thus should be given appropriate weight when attributing likely causation in cases with criminal allegations.”

3.	I use the American classification of sleep disorders (3rd ed) as a guide as it is the most comprehensive. That does not necessarily mean that my opinion may not diverge from their guidelines. Any major diversion will be noted and explained.

4.	There are several reasons why the role of alcohol on sleepwalking is controversial:
a)	 because there is very little scientific or laboratory data on the relationship. There are no experiments that dose sleepwalkers with alcohol.
